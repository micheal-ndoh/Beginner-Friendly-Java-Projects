# Beginner-Friendly-Java-Projects

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Java projects that are designed to help developers practice core Java concepts such as loops, methods, object-oriented programming (OOP), and file I/O. The projects cover a wide range of topics, including a calculator, a guessing game, a library management system, a rock-paper-scissors game, a simple chatbot, a student grade tracker, and a to-do list.

Other Projects will be added soon.
